# Audio-Based Machine Learning using PCA and SVM

## Project Description

This project is an audio-based machine learning system developed as part of an academic Machine Learning assignment. The project focuses on processing raw audio data and converting it into meaningful frequency-domain features for classification tasks.

The workflow includes audio feature extraction, data analysis, dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project aims to improve model efficiency while maintaining classification performance.

## Dataset
The audio dataset used in this project is available on Google Drive:(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16btNQ87dGtYf-aIlFMHKJ6SME2uf5iY4?usp=sharing)
